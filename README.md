## **Summary**

In this groundbreaking initiative, participants are transported into a world where CME expertise and problem-solving skills are put to the ultimate test. Participants are immersed in escape room scenarios that draw upon real-world CME experiences. The participants not only have a fun and interesting time solving puzzles and unlocking doors, but also can also learn from the experience. With each puzzle solved participants earn knowledge, seamlessly integrating learning into an adventure of discovery.
