## Topics Discussed
The meeting with the client has not been scheduled yet, since we are currently recieving radio silence. A second email is planned to touch bases as soon as possible, otherwise, we contact our professor.

The only thing we have to reference is the project requirements, and the document itself has brought up many questions by the team.
* What is the 'wow factor'?
* What kind of levels are they wanting?
* Is this game going to be 2D or 3D?
* Will this game be hosted on their platform or our own?
* Will one person be hosting the game or multiple?
These questions will require the client to be present.

Tech Stack will go either 2 ways:
* Godot - A game engine that works both as a client and a website.
* ReactJS - A website engine that uses typescript or javascript to create frontend sites.

Version Control can be done using Git Bash(Terminal) or GitKraken(Interface)

Our meeting minutes, when it comes to the client, will be detailed based on our today's discussion.

The prototype of the game will be very basic, meaning no title screen or leaderboard. The concept idea needs to be shown, where completing a puzzle unlocks a room to win. It is very possible to complete if it is in 2D, but 3D will increase production time.
