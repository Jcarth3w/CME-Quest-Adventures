Ethan, Micah, Justyn, Jared, Jack

## Location/Medium
In Person: RB 369

## Topics Discussed
This meeting we made sure that linter was working properly and refactoring our code to make sure it passes through the Linter properly. We already worked with
linter in the past so it didn't take up too much time. Micah also showed us a few things that he refactored before the meeting. Jared updated development.md to
include the linter steps.

## Things Clarified
After refactoring we would like to start to split up tasks for everyone to work on throughout the week. This way we can accomplish more and meet less overall. 
Some of the tasks that were split was the leaderboard and working on iteration two. We also looked into programs for code coverage and found one called godot 
coverage hack. We plan on looking into that this week to see if we can get it to officially check code coverage.

## Tasks Distributed
Ethan: Work on GUI and design elements of minigames
Jack: write more tests
Justyn: Start drafting ideas for the new scenario
Jared: Work on code coverages and database website
Micah: figure out hover effects and work on refactor
