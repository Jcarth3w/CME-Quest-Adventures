## Topics Discussed
As a group we went over the structure of the project by looking at the different nodes that connect to each other. This helped us decide how to wrap up
refactoring for iteration three. From there we started on touching the database as a group to make sure everyone is on the same page. We are working on the
ability for the game to send data to the database properly upon completing a scenario.

## Things Clarified
This week is a little bit complicated as one of the members (Ethan) will be out of time for a short amount of time. We are going to have to do online meetings and 
split up tasks to work around that. The goal is to touch up the database and refactor so when we come back for the start of next week we can solely work on more
features. On top of that we would like to start designing room three this week.

## Tasks Distributed 

Ethan: Work on swapping out the assets over the week and help out at meetings when avalible
Jack Jared Justyn Micah: Work on the database/refactor some more through mob programming
