## Topic Discussion
This meeting we worked on the matching minigame and inventory using mob programming. Most of the issues of the matching minigame was fixed, besides being able to delay the flipped cards before they swap back. This will be
fixed when we complete all of the other high priority features for iteration one. The inventory is working properly and we feel that it is ready to go for iteration two. After working we discussed the remaining tasks
and which ones to work on before our next meeting Sunday.

## Things Clarified
This following week we plan on completing a list of remaining features before coming together to start setting up the room level. The goal is to have the layout completed by Wednesday for our client and then afterwards 
use the remaining time to work on lower priority features.

## Task Distributed
Ethan: Work on the folder minigame

Jack: Work on the shredder minigame

Micah/Jared: Work on saving progress when switching scenes.

Justyn wasn't at the meeting but we discussed letting him pick which task he wanted to work on. Shared all the tasks with him on discord.
