## Topics Discussed
This meeting we worked on the laptop minigame for room three of scenario one. We made it possible for players to type in a set of keywords to unlock the second
phase of the game. For phase two of the game we created buttons that opens a folder sllowing players to select and "print" a document. That printed document
will be needed for the end of the level.

## Things Clarified
Fuctionality for room three is going smoothly, going forward we will start working on the smaller details of room three and making sure everything works properly
without bugs. The goal is to finish room three this week so we can do a main menu on the last week.

## Tasks Distributed
Mob programming a couple more times this week to finish room three.
