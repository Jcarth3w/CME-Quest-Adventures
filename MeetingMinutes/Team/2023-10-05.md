## Topics Discussed
We started to work on the following assignments due October 11th.

* Business Requirements
  
Two business requirements were created and paragraphs justifying their existence was also made. The document on github has been filled out
and while the document is subject to change it's likely we are done with this assignment.

* Requirements
  
We created more functional requirements and started to brainstorm and create some non-functional requirements as well.
Priority has not yet been assigned to the requirements that will be accomplished in a later meeting.

We are planning to work on the domain model over the weekend and after discussing with our client on Monday 11th we should have enough information for
the remaining assignments as well.
