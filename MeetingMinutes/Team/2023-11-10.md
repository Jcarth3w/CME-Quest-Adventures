## Topics Discussed
This meeting we mob programmed to complete a few features. The first of which is giving an item into the player's inventory upon completing the minigame. Next 
we made sure that upon completing the minigame it is no longer replayable. Lastly we added an endstate for grabbing every single required item that stops the
timer and gives a you win notification.

## Things Clarified
At this point we think we've done everything required for iteration one besides replacing some last minute assets. Now we just need to complete all the other
documents required for the end of iteration and we're good to go!

## Tasks Distributed
No tasks currently distributed besides meeting up and completing the remaining documents together and preparing the presentation.
