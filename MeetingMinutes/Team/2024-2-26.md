## Topics Discussed
This meeting we started out by emailing Lani. We discussed potential additions to scenario one and two to make the game more education as a whole.
Afterwards we discussed what we are going to do for meetings the next few weeks during Spring Break. 

## Things clarified
We are waiting on a response from Lani to figure out certain education materials and then from there we will provide a list of assets we would like drawn on Thursday.
Before we meet with Lani we plan on sending both Lani and Kurt an executable to play the game themselves so we don't have to worry about zoom being an issue. We plan
on meeting Wednesday and Thursday, and then twice next week.
