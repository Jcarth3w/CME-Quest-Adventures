## Topics Discussed
This meeting we worked on connecting room three to the scenario and then built a combo lock to unlock travel from room two to room three. Now you are able to
freely travel all three rooms of scenario one without having to need to complete every puzzle in each room. This will give more of an escape room style especially
in later scenarios. 

## Things Clarified
Going into the last week our goal is to focus on finishing room three. Other features will be worked on their own time outside of the group. We're trying to get
as much done as possible.

## Tasks Distributed
