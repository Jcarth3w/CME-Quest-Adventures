## Location/Medium
In Person: RB 369

## Topics Discussed
We started the meeting by attempting to merge SFX. We had merge conflicts with scenario and room so we spent time fixing those conflicts. We tweaked some of the 
timing of the sounds as well to be timed better in the minigames.

## Things Clarified
This week we plan on wrapping up remaining scenario one tasks before spending the final week working through the final room of scenario two. We're unsure if assets
will arrive in time. If that is the case then Ethan will need to work on temporary assets to ensure we have a product that's finalized before the end of iteration
five.

## Tasks Distributed
Ethan: Work on updating File Minigame

Jack: update matching minigame

Justyn: Start working on Room Five

Jared: continue working on firebase

Micah: update matching minigame
