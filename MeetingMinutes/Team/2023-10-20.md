## Topics Discussed
This meeting we spent most of the time troubleshooting issues discovered on gitkraken. We messed up a little when attempting to implement feature branching so after figuring out what went wrong we
made a second repository for our code. 

## Things Clarified
The features that aren't finished are still being worked on until Monday. From there, we will create a new list of features to implement and start working on the design of the first puzzle.

## Tasks Distributed 
Justyn: Create a HUD scene.

Jack: Create a timer that counts up from zero.

Ethan: Write and submit the meeting minutes for this week. 

Micah: Create inventory to show what you've picked up.
