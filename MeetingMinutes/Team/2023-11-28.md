## Topics Discussed
We've recently ran into an issue where we had two branches merged into together, so after troubleshooting the issue we spent some time making sure everything was
working as intended. From there we started to work on room 2 for the project in mob programming fashion. Specifically working on the crossword puzzle minigame 
that is the primary feature of room two.

## Things Clarified
The plan is to continue working on the project as much as possible using mob programming. We still want to get both a leaderboard and room 2 added this iteration
it will just requrie us to work as much as possible to make sure everything is up and ready to go.

## Tasks Distributed
Mostly mob programming, but occassionally Jared and Jack will be focusing on leaderboard on their own while Micah, Justyn, and Ethan will be working on
Room 2 in their off time.
