## Topics Discussed
Before the meeting Jack worked on adding tests for new features added. On top of that Ethan worked on adding an objective button that now lists all the objectives
in the hud. After that we started working on the final minigame for room 3. The final minigame is going to be two stages. The first stage is going to be the promotional
folder minigame. After that the player needs to organize all the papers they grabbed into alphabetical order and place it into the folder to complete the scenario.

## Things Clarified
For the final week of the project we are going to finish working on room three as a group. Outside of that we plan to connect the database once the scenario is fully
finished and multiple visuals are going to be updated.

## Tasks distributed
Jack and Jared are going to be working on the database connection and Ethan is going to be updating the visuals and UI. Justyn and Micah are working on the main
room. Lastly, Jack will also be adding more tests.
