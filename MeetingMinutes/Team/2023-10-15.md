## Topics Discussed

* Godot Basics
This meeting had a major focus on trying to learn Godot for the first time. Micah who is our most experienced with godot showed us various tips and tricks to understand the basics better.

* Planning future meetings
Another focus was planning out how we're going to handle coding sessions for the first and second iteration of this semester. The initial plan that we have come up with is to meet once early
in the week (Monday-Tuesday) and then to meet a second time on the second half of the week (Thursday-Friday). This is subject to change based on how much progress is made over the next few weeks.
