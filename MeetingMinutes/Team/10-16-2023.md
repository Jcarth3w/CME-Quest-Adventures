## Topics Discussed
At this meeting everyone worked on installing GitKraken onto their laptops. From there Jared discussed the basics of GitKraken and Micah went
into more depth on how to use Godot. Our first set of tasks for the project was distributed and we're all eager to start coding.

## Things Clarified
Going into next week, we would like to finish all of our first set of distributed tasks, starting to make progress towards making the game look like
a basic version of the prototype we worked on in the design folders. 

## Tasks Distributed
Justyn: Create a HUD scene.

Jack: Create a timer that counts up from zero.

Ethan: Create room scene with a placeholder image for the background.

Micah: Create inventory to show what you've picked up.

Jared: Create clickable object with function: add_to_inventory()
