## Topics Discussed 
This meeting we met with both Lani and Kurt to present what we've accomplished for iteration four. We went through both scenario one and two and displayed how
the leaderboard in game will look. Afterwards we sat down and discussed final features and how they would like to recieve the project. 

## Things Clarified
Kurt uses a mac system which is currently uncompatible with the game, because of this we plan to post the game on itch.io so they can mess around with it more. He
also suggested adding a help system which is something we want to include in Iteration five. He said we were doing great effort overall and Lani agreed.
