## Topics Discussed
This meeting we decided to allow Lani to playtest our project for the end of the iteration. Zoom was giving us issues but eventually we were able to demonstrate
all of the features we finished this iteration. She was impressed with what we had added over the span of a few days since our last meeting and mentioned
that Kurt is really excited for the project overall.

## Things Clarified
We talked about plans for iteration four to continue improving player responsiveness on top of making the level more modular. This way it's easier to create
levels in the future. We also want to send a list of items that still need assets for them so we can fully update all pieces of the level. Lastly we plan on
sending Kurt and Lani executables of the game so they can play it while waiting for the final version of the project.
