## Topics Discussed

For this meeting we briefly went over the features implemented so far, that being multiple buttons and the hud for the game. From there we explained that our goal for iteration one is to
make a single room that's completely playable/functional. Lani was relatively happy with everything completed so far and has no personal requests or questions for what we've accomplished at this point.

## Things Clarified

We scheduled a meeting for the last week of the first iteration where we will show off the final product and ask for any last minute changes they would like on the room. Our goal is to continue to work
on the room and provide Lani with a list of objects we would like assets drawn for.
