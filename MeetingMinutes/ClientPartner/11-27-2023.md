## Topics Discussed
We went over our plans for iteration two with Lani today. We discussed how we would like to give them the opportunity to play the game on Friday. We discussed
further questions and if we have any for Kurt we could write it in the document provided by Lani.

## Things Clarified
We told Lani how we plan to work on a majority of iteration two this week and at the end we plan to hand them the software through zoom to playtest. Hopefully we
should have most of room 2 completed by Friday.
