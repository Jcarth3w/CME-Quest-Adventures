## Topics Discussed

For this meeting we allowed Lani to playtest the game herself. Using zoom we allowed her to take over Jack's screen to play the game on godot. We displayed
all the current features and the new ones added to iteration two that we've added so far. After the playtest Jared shared our progress on creating a database
for the leaderboard. After play testing we discussed adding instructions on the minigame to make things more clear for the player. Other than that Lani was 
really happy with the project overall! We scheduled 

## Things clarified

We told Lani we plan on making the room look nice and add clarity so the puzzles are a little bit more straightforward. We also mentioned that if she
wants certain elements added to the crossword that she can send us a document with clues and other words and we will implement them into room 2. For iteration 3
we plan on adding instructions to the minigames so the player knows how to interact with them on top of adding the last room for the first scenario. Lastly we will
continue to update the leaderboard to make it work with the game itself.
