## Topics Discussed 

For this meeting, we wanted to show Lani our progress on the completion of of room. Our room consisted of the three minigames/puzzles, accompanied with three more items availble through out the room that can be picked up and added to the inventory. Including, some moveable/clickable items that will improve the rooms atmosphere. We also discussed the acquisition of offical assests from Lani and her team. Lani was quite happy with our progress and pleased to hear our future plans for how the later iterations will proceed. Her main feedback was that she wanted more puzzle varity. 

## Things Clarified

For things clarified, we were able to get our offical assests to be put in progress. We didn't schedule a meeting just yet, but set possible future dates in advance. Finally, we clarified the structure of how future rooms will be setup.
