## Topics Discussed 

For this meeting, we wanted to show Lani our progress on the completion of our room. Our room consisted of the three minigames/puzzles, accompanied by three more items available throughout the room that can be picked up and added to the inventory. Including some moveable/clickable items that will improve the room's atmosphere. We also discussed the acquisition of official assets from Lani and her team. Lani was quite happy with our progress and pleased to hear our future plans for how the later iterations will proceed. Her main feedback was that she wanted more puzzle variety. 

## Things Clarified

For things clarified, we were able to get our official assets to be put in progress. We haven't schedule a meeting just yet but set possible future dates in advance. Finally, we clarified the structure of how future rooms will be set up.
