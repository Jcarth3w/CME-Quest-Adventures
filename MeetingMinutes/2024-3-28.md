## Topics Discussed
Starting out we fixed a few bugs on static scenes and merged a few completed branches into master. Then we worked on fixing a few bugs in the room 5 branch. Some progress was made and we merged the drag and drop code
so we could add it to the laptop minigame as well.

## Things Clarified
We got a few branches merged today, but for the most part work continues on features we touched on Monday. Lani sent us an email with more educational content they would like in their games. We plan on implementing some 
of these into both scenario one and two. We also learned that our list of assets will be arriving on April 5th.
