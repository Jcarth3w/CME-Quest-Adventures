## Topics Discussed
This meeting we worked on making pick up fully functional. Spending a hour making it so that whenever the player picksup an item a little pop up shows at the
bottom of the screen. It also disappears 2.5 seconds afterwards, allowing enough time for the player to read the message but not enough to get in the way. After
that we started to work on the presentation for iteration 3, working on slides in the powerpoint.

## Things Clarified
At this point we're about done with the work for this iteration. It's polishing and then the documents outside of coding. With that said we plan to meet with Lani
for a second time to make sure she's fully happy with everything on Monday. We are also going to look through our test to make sure that we have 70% coverage, but we
are pretty confident we reached that mark.
