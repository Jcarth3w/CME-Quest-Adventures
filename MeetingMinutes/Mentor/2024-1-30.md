## Topics Discussed
This meeting we showed Hunter what we've accomplished so far this iteration. Demonstrating our vision for being able to travel through all the rooms before solving
every puzzle. There were a few bugs that we discovered and as a result decided to dedicate part of the meeting fixing whatever issues we ran into.

## Things Clarified 
Talked about wanting to refactor hud going into iteration four. We discussed how we're happy with how our features are functional but there is still a lot more 
polish that needs to be completed before Monday. Hunter suggested talking to Lani to see what she wants out of iteration one. Other than that Hunter is really
happy with how the project is going and glad to see the group working well together.
