Hunter shed some light on his previous experience with first iteration. 

Hunter is looking to communicate with a past group who made a game to help give us some clarity.

Hunter talked about tech stack and scope of project, to understand where we were.

Hunter also helped us look at unit testing for the future.

We emailed our client to better understand scope and get clarity on certain requirements, such as leaderboard and web access.
