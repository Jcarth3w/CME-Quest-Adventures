## Topics Discussed
This meeting there was a big focus on refactoring, starting with how the pause function works. Sometimes when switching scenes or opening minigames pausing would happen unexpectedly so we really wanted to iron out
these issues before moving forward. After finishing, Hunter had joined the call so we spent some time discussing plans with him. Particularly about our database and other features planned for iteration three.
Going back to our code we changed many of the owner references to get_parent to prevent long term issues.

(To be finished tomorrow)
