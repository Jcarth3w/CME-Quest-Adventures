## Topics Discussed
This meeting there was a big focus on refactoring, starting with how the pause function works. Sometimes when switching scenes or opening minigames pausing would happen unexpectedly so we really wanted to iron out
these issues before moving forward. After finishing, Hunter had joined the call so we spent some time discussing plans with him. Particularly about our database and other features planned for iteration three.
Going back to our code we changed many of the owner references to get_parent to prevent long term issues. 

## Things Clarified
The plan for this week is to wrap up refactoring and planning out the design for room 3. Ethan will be out of state for the later half of the week so he plans on working on replacing the assets with the one provided by Lani over the next few days. The rest of the group will be messing around with the database and then eventually splitting up to work on both database and room 3 at the same time to cover more group. Planned meetings this week are Monday Tuesday and Friday.
