## Topics Discussed
This meeting we started off by showing Hunter what we've accomplished iteration four. He said that was he was blown away with what we had accomplished. Afterwards
we worked as a group to export the game so that Lani and Kurt can play the game themselves. 

## Things Clarified
We talked about what we wanted to do in the final iteration. We included finishing scenario 2 and continuing to add features that make the game feel polished
such as sounds and animation. We also mentioned including untouched elements from Lani's draft to include into scenario 1 and 2. We won't have time to make four
scenarios so combining draft ideas is a good way to get as much of the learning content into the game as possible. Overall Hunter seems really happy with everything
we've done so far.
