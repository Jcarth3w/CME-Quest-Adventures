## Topics discussed
This meeting we catched up Hunter on what we've done at the start of the iteration. This includes the test coverage and the refactors Micah accomplished so far. Jack went into detail about how the tests function on godot. 
Jared worked on testing in the backend. Justyn showed his progress on iteration 2 and Ethan pulled up some UI updates for the room select. Afterwards there was discussion about what's left to do such as 
leaderboard, room 4, and hover over effects. Hunter seemed impress with what we had so far and said that we're continuing to kill it. 

## Things Clarified
We discussed continuing to work on the first room of the second iteration and hopefully adding hover effects by the end of this week. Hunter offered to ask his peers if we ever have questions that he himself can't answer.
