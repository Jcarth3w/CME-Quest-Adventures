## Our Experience...

We made a mistake when registering for the student symposium. We only registered for the oral presentation.
This causeed us to basically get kicked out of the exhibition showcase. After this, We prepped everything for the oral presentation
and then found people to try out the game there. Afterwards we asked some people in Robert Bell if they'd like to play 
and hear about it. This went very well. We did our best, given the circumstances to make this work. And we did still present
for the Student Symposium.

Everyone agreed to just write about this as a team, since we didn't really get to experience much of the exhibition.
