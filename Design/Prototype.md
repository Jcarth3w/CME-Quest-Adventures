# Prototype for CME Quest Adventures
### The Printer Problem!

The main idea of this prototype is to demonstrate a point and click game with multiple, abstract scenes. In here, we depict a heads-up display with the main objective displayed, followed by the inventory and game timer. We hope that players who play this will be focused on completing the game fast and utilizing the tools they collect in the scene.
