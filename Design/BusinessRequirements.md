# Business Requirements

* (BR1) An employee can play scenarios related to the role in the workplace.

  After the first discovery meeting, the client has stated that they would like puzzles consisting of different scenarios in the workplace.
  This should include the different roles or tasks that certain cme employees should have.
  This is measurable in the game by the tasks given in the puzzle.
  The business requirement can be considered to have been met if the puzzles demonstrate the real world tasks that you would find working at CME.

* (BR2) An employee can test their knowledge by completing the final puzzle in a scenario.

  During our own discussion, looking at the initial document.
  The client wants a dynamic learning pathway, so we can use this principle to test their knowledge of the user going through the experience.
  The game will include a final puzzle before transitioning to an end screen, recapping what the usersâ€™ knowledge that should have been retained.
  This is measurable in the game because, to complete the final puzzle, it will include information that was present throughout the experience.
  This is also a business requirement in the way that the user must learn from the experience.
