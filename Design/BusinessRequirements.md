# Business Requirements

* (BR1) Employees can learn CME concepts in a fun way.

  The client expressed to us that they want the game to cover informational topics related to CME. They have given us material
  to help accomplish this goal.  They also expressed wanting the game to be fun and have a "wow" factor. This is measurable through
  play testing and surveys. This is a business requirement because it is not specific to the software requirements, but rather a larger goal
  of why the company wants to make a game.

* (BR2) The product should be useful to any CME organization.

  During our own discussion, and in the initial document, the client describes that this game should cover general CME. This way
  that it can be used across the field, and it is not only specific to Stanford CME. They have given us materials to accomplish
  this goal. This is a business requirement because the organization has a desire to distribute this if they want to.
