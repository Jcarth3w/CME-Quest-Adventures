## Godot
- https://godotengine.org/

We chose this because it seemed to best way to create a game. It's free and a few of us have had previous experience with it.
It offers an easy way to integrate code with simple asset manipulation.


## GitKraken
- https://www.gitkraken.com/

We chose this as an implementation for version control. Godot does not have built version control, we're using GitKraken to provide an interface for controlling updates to the project.


## React
- https://react.dev/

We chose React as a way to implement the game we make in Godot into the web. React provides an easy way to implement outside sources into a web format, some of us have previous experience in React as well.

## MySQL
- https://www.mysql.com/

We chose MySQL as a way to create a database for player usernames, passwords and best times, as well as best times for each scenario. MySQL provides an easy way to make a database, and makes retrieving data fairly simple.
